{"Q1.1 You are investigating long latencies in Cloud Bigtable query response times.": " Most queries  \nfinish in less than 20 ms, but the 99th percentile queries can take up to 400 ms. You  \nexamine a Key Visualizer heatmap and see two areas with bright colors indicating hotspots.  \nWhat could be causing those hotspots?  \nA. Improperly used secondary index  \nB. Less than optimal partition key  \nC. Improperly designed row -key \nD. Failure to use a read replica  \n", "Q2.3 An IoT startup has hired you to review their Cloud Bigtable design.": " The database stores  \ndata generated by over 100,000 sensors that send data every 60 seconds. Each row contains  \nall the data f or one sensor sent during an hour. Hours always start at the top of the hour.  \nThe row -key is the sensor ID concatenated to the hour of the day followed by the date.  \nWhat change, if any, would you recommend to this design?  \nA. Use one row per sensor and 60 -second datasets instead of storing multiple datasets in a  \nsingle row.  \nB. Start the row keyrow -key with the day and hour instead of the sensor ID.  \nC. Allow hours to start an any arbitrary time to accommodate differences in sensor  \nclocks.  \nD. No change is recommended.  \n", "P3.12 Your company has a Cloud Bigtable database that requires strong consistency, but it also  \nrequires high availability.": " You have implemented Cloud Bigtable replication and specified  \nsingle -cluster routing in the app profile for the database. Some users have noted that they  \noccasionally receive query results inconsistent with what they should have received. The  \nproblem seems to correct itself within a minute. What could be the cause of  this problem?  \nA. Secondary indexes are being updated during the query and return incorrect results  \nwhen a secondary index is not fully updated.  \nB. You have not specified an app configuration file that includes single -cluster routing and  \nuse of replicas on ly for failover.  \nC. Tablets are being moved between nodes, which can cause inconsistent query results.  \nD. The row -key is not properly designed.  \nR 4. 17 You have been tasked with migrating a MongoDB database to Cloud Spanner. MongoDB  \nis a document database, similar to Cloud Firestore. You would like to maintain some of   \n the document organization of the MongoDB design.

Execution plans  \n", "Q6.2.3.1 A Cloud Spanner database is using a natural key as the primary key for a large table.": " The natural  \nkey is the preferred key by users because the values are easy to relate to other data. Database  \nadministrator s notice that these keys are causing hotspots on Cloud Spanner nodes and are  \nadversely affecting performance. What would you recommend in order to improve performance?  \nA. Keep the data of the natural key in the table but use a hash of the natural key as th e \nprimary key  \nB. Keep the natural key and let Cloud Spanner create more splits to improve performance  \nC. Use interleaved tables  \nD. Use more secondary indexes  \n", "Q7.2.1.2 You are using a UUID as the primary key in a Cloud Spanner database.": " You have noticed  \nhotspotti ng that you did not anticipate. What could be the cause?  \nA. You have too many secondary indexes.  \nB. You have too few secondary indexes.  \nC. You are using a type of UUID that has sequentially ordered strings at the beginning of  \nthe UUID.  \nD. You need to make the maximum length of the primary key longer.  \n", "Q8.1 You are working for a financial services firm on a Cloud Bigtable database.": " The database  \nstores equity and bond trading information from approximately 950 customers. Over  \n10,000 equities and bonds are tracked in the database. New data is received at a rate of  \n5,000 data points per minute. What general design pattern would you recommend?  \nA.

Option A and Option C  \n", "Q9.6.9 You have been brought into a large enterprise to help  with a data warehousing initiative.": " The  \nfirst project of the initiative is to build a repository for all customer -related data, including sales,  \nfinance, inventory, and logistics. It has not yet been determined how the data will be used. What  \nGoogle Cloud  storage system would you recommend that the enterprise use to store that data?  \nA. Cloud Bigtable  \nB.

Data that arrives the next day will be written to  \na different partition. The data modeler did not specify a column to use as a partition key.  \nWhat kind  of partition is being used?  \nA.

A fter that, it is  \nloaded into a partitioned table. You want to have efficient access to the most interesting  \ndata, which you define as a particular measurement having a value greater than 100.00.  \nYou want to cluster on that measurement column, which is a FL OAT64. When you define  \nthe table with a timestamped partitioned table and clustering on the measurement column,   \n you receive an error. What could that error be?  \nA. You cannot use clustering on an external table.  \nB. You cannot use clustering with a FLOAT64 c olumn as the clustering key.  \nC. The table is not the FLOAT64 partition type.  \nD. The clustering key must be an integer or timestamp.  \n", "Q12.3.2 What data formats are supported for external tables in Cloud Storage and Google Drive?": "  \nA. Comma -separated values only  \nB.
